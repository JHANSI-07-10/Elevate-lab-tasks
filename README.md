ðŸ§¹ Mall Customer Dataset - Data Cleaning (Excel)
This repository contains a cleaned version of the Mall Customer Dataset, processed using Microsoft Excel. The dataset provides demographic and behavioral information about mall customers, including their spending scores and income.

ðŸ“„ Dataset Overview
The original dataset included the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Gender: Gender of the customer

Age: Age in years

Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars

Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

âœ… Cleaning Steps Performed in Excel
Handled Missing Values

Used Excel filters to identify and address missing cells by either filling in values where appropriate or removing the affected rows.

Removed Duplicate Rows

Used Excelâ€™s "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate any duplicate entries and ensure each row represented a unique customer.

Standardized Text Values

Normalized values in columns like Gender (e.g., changed all entries to lowercase: male, female) to ensure consistency.

Converted Date Formats (if applicable)

(Note: The dataset did not include dates, but if any are added later, formatting will follow dd-mm-yyyy standard.)

Renamed Column Headers

Cleaned column names to be lowercase with no spaces or special characters:

CustomerID â†’ customer_id

Gender â†’ gender

Age â†’ age

Annual Income (k$) â†’ annual_income_k

Spending Score (1-100) â†’ spending_score

Checked and Corrected Data Types

Ensured:

age is a number

annual_income_k is numeric

spending_score is numeric
