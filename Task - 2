# 📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard – Power BI

This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship (Task 2)** at **Elevate Labs**. I worked with the **Superstore Sales Dataset** and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover key business insights and visualize sales performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore and understand sales, profit, and quantity trends across various dimensions such as products, customers, and categories.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Superstore Sales Dataset**, which includes information on:

- Orders (Dates, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Sales)
- Customers and Regions
- Product Categories and Sub-Categories
- Shipping and Segment data

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – for building the interactive dashboard
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – for initial data handling
- **Power Query Editor** – for data transformation within Power BI

## 📊 Dashboard Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

- **Bar Chart** – Sales by Product Name  
- **Area Chart** – Quantity Ordered by Customer  
- **Donut Charts** –  
  - Total Quantity by Country  
  - Total Sales by Country  
- **Line Chart** – Sales Trend by Category  
- **Scatter Plot** – Profit per Product

These visuals help identify high-performing products, customer buying patterns, category trends, and profit distribution.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Top products generate a significant portion of total sales.
- Quantity varies widely across customer base, indicating segmented buying behavior.
- Some countries contribute more to sales/quantity than others.
- Line chart reveals seasonal or category-based sales trends.
- Scatter plot highlights which products are profitable and which might be underperforming.
